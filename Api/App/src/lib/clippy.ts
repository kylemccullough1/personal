 * clippyjs was written for a page, not a desktop inside a page. It appends its element to
 * <body> with position: fixed, clamps every move and drag to window.innerWidth/innerHeight,
 * and re-clamps on window resize. That is exactly why Clippy could be dragged over the bezel
 * and under the taskbar: as far as the library knew, the whole browser window was his desk.
 *
 * The fix is to make the desktop element his parent. Inside a position: relative,
 * overflow: hidden container he physically cannot leave the screen, and his left/top become
 * desktop coordinates, which is what the tours think in anyway. The library's own drag and
 * resize handlers are removed because both still measure against the viewport; placement is
 * ours from here on. He is pointer-transparent during a tour so he never blocks a window, and
 * clickable on the desk (see setClippyInteractive).
